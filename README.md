Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions

Project Goal: Develop and compare models to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant analysis, Quadratic discriminant analysis. 

Conclusion:
For this dataset, among the three models used for prediction, the logistic regression model seems to be the most accurate. 
Although the confusion matrix accuracy of the LR and LDA seems to be close, but the overall performance of the LR model seems better due to less false negatives
Future works may include removing the insignificant variables and finding ways to improve the prediction efficiency.
